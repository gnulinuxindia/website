# GNU/Linux India

## _A place for Indian Linux enthusiasts._

**GNU/Linux India** is an Indian group of GNU/Linux enthusiasts who like to discuss, develop and provide guidance on free software. While the name says GNU/Linux India, we are open to all types of software discussion _(as long as it's not proprietary ;) )_.
